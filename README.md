This is a minimal RP2040 passthrough program. This code is taken from the https://github.com/Project-Stinger/Firmware/tree/main firmware, which was written by Bastian. Thank you for sharing your work!

This is designed to run on a generic RP2040 board. Simply define your pins at the top of main.cpp and then flash. Use AM32.ca or blhelisuite to configure. 

This program is free and I am not responsible if you brick or damage anything using this.
